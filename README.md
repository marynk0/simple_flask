# simple_flask
simple "hello world" application in flask 
i created a py file, template folder (html) and static folder(css)
in the app.py, i imported the required libraries i.e flask, render_template, url_for
i linked the app.py file to the html(render_template), css (url_for)
i linked the html file to css file using (<link rel =""........)
then checked to see if i follow the link if it opens the css file
initially it did not, so i created a new file using the link path and copy pasted the css code
in the terminal i ran "flask run"
this opened the flask application in my web browser
